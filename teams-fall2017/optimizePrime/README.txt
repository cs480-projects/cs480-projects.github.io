A simple single pager built around an angular motif (powered by SVG awesomeness).
Should work great for a landing page. Also includes default styling for a bunch of
standard page elements (uncomment the huge block of commented-out HTML to see it).

you can use for pretty much whatever.

Feedback, bug reports, and comments are not only welcome, but strongly encouraged :)

PS: Not sure how to get that contact form working? Give formspree.io a try (it's awesome).
