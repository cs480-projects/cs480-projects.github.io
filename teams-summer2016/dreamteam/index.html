		<h2>Travel Just Right</h2>
		<h3>Dream Team | Cal Poly Pomona | Summer 2016</h3>
				
		<h4>About</h4>
		<p>For Cal Poly Pomona's CS480 course, Software Engineering, a group of four students created a Web service that helps users answer a
		simple vacation question: When should I go? In deciding what problem to solve for our class project, we noticed that while many 
		websites offer suggestions on when to visit a destination in the form of articles, none, to our knowledge, distill this information
		in an easy-to-digest format. This led us to create <a href="http://www.traveljustright.com">Travel Just Right</a>. You simply select a destination, select your preferences, and our
		algorithm will tell you when to visit. 
		</p>

		<h4>Dream Team Members</h4>
		<p>Zachary Coulson, Jason Zhang, Jason La and Rocky Qiu. Guidance from <a href="http://www.yusun.io/">Professor Yu Sun</a>.</p>
		
		<h4>More on Travel Just Right</h4>
		<p><a href="http://www.traveljustright.com">Travel Just Right</a> combines user input (temperature and crowd-level) with data to recommend for users the best months to visit a 
		destination based on their preferences. Presently, we only offer suggestions for America's 59 national parks. We started with these
		destinations because they're among the country's top destinations and the National Park Service does a great job with providing 
		visitation data on its properties.</p> 
		
		<p>For even more information on Travel Just Right, take a look at these 
		<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Da3_vA093DIrB5g6qzjejwxkNdNGfO9sKRj4IfRm3DQ/edit#slide=id.p">slides</a>.</p>

		<h4>Our recommendations</h4>
		<p>Our suggestions are simply a starting point for planning your trip and should be paired with careful research. We hope to refine our recommendations
		to account for more data points helpful in deciding when to visit a destination.</p>

		<h4>Our data</h4>
		<p>Our visitation data is taken from NPS's <a href="https://irma.nps.gov/Portal">Integrated Resource Management Applications (IRMA) Portal</a>. 
		For each park, we averaged monthly recreational visits from 2006 to 2015. Our historical weather data is taken from 
		<a href="http://www.usclimatedata.com">www.usclimatedata.com</a>.</p>
