Hunger app helps users to find the nearest restaurant based on what they want. 
Users can search for cafe, restaurant, or bar. Users can choose what meal they want, breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Hunger app will show users nearest locations to eat based on what they search for. Users can search for any city in any country.

How use the app: 
Hunger app can be open on any web browser or mobile. 
At the beginning, app will ask users to allow the app to know users’ location for finding the nearest place, but if users do not allow, the app will show all places in the city which was searched by the user. 
It will show the places to eat from the highest to the lowest customers’ rate. 
Users can click on website under the images of each place to see the location and time of the place. 
It does not have login/sign in page because people want to find the place to eat fast.
